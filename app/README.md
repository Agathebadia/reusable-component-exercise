# reusable-component-exercise

- Display files using .json format
- Create template 'files' to display the main structure of the table
- Create component 'file' to display each iteration using Ember #each
- Style the table using inline-grid and distribute space depending on the width of the element
e.g. Path and its elements are larger, therefore have larger width, in order to not overlap other cells
